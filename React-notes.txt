React: 
1. JS library to build User interfaces.
2. All about components to build UI and update UI.

ReactDOM: Interface to the web. React does not know anything about browser. It only knows about the components and manages States. Doesn't care if components contains HTML or anything else.

              Context (Component Wide data)
              |
              |
Props --> Components --> React DOM --> Real DOM (What users see)
              |
              |
              State (Internal Data)

Props, state and context affect(re-render/re-evaluated) components.


How React works?

render function --> Component instantiates itself --> Initializes Props and state --> Returns Object(Element) and hence creates a tree a elements called a virtual dom.
This virtual DOM is destroyed and created from scratch.
Diffing algorithm runs 
ReactDOM receives the differences and manipulates the real DOM.

Real DOM does not change all the time. It is only changed for difference between evaluations.
Virtual DOM changes all the time since it is not memory intensive.
